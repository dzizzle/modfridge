#Hi! This is my modern fridge application, you can add existing items in your fridge so that when you grocery shop you can remember which ingredients you have or don't have 

#This app was created using MERN (mongoose, express, react, and node.js) as well as some HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. It also includes 7 RESTful routes with basic CRUD.
